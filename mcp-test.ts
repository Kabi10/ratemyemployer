// This file demonstrates how to use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Cursor
// Run the MCP server with: npm run mcp:start
// Then you can use natural language to query your database

// Example 1: Get all companies
// Show me all companies in the database

// Example 2: Find reviews with low ratings
// Find all reviews with ratings lower than 3

// Example 3: Get company statistics
// What's the average rating across all companies?

// Example 4: Find companies by industry
// Show me all companies in the Technology industry

// Example 5: Get recent reviews
// Show me the most recent reviews submitted in the last month

// Example 6: Find companies with no reviews
// Which companies don't have any reviews yet?

// Example 7: Compare industries
// Compare the average ratings between the Technology and Healthcare industries

// Example 8: Find top-rated companies
// What are the top 5 highest-rated companies?

// Example 9: Get review trends

// 3. MCP will translate your natural language query into a database query
// 4. Results will be displayed in Cursor
