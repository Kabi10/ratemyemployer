# Pre-Implementation Checklist

## Feature: README.md Updates

### 1. Search Results
```
# Search commands run:
grep_search "mcp:update-schema" results:
No results found in README.md

grep_search "migrations:run" results:
No results found in README.md

list_dir "docs" results:
Contains documentation files but no specific migration documentation
```

### 2. Findings Documentation

#### Existing Files Found:
- README.md (main project documentation)
- MCP_DOCUMENTATION.md (MCP-specific documentation)

#### Existing Functionality:
- README.md contains sections for development commands
- README.md has a section on MCP integration
- No specific section for database migrations

#### Gaps Identified:
- New scripts added to package.json are not documented in README.md
- No documentation on how to update MCP schema
- No documentation on database migrations

#### Implementation Decision Tree:
- Is there existing code that serves this purpose? Yes (README.md exists)
- Can existing code be enhanced to meet requirements? Yes (by adding new sections)
- Is creating new code justified? No (only documentation updates needed)

### 3. Proposed Approach:
- [x] Enhance existing code at README.md
- [ ] Create new files (not needed)
- [ ] Refactor existing code (not needed)

### 4. Implementation Plan:
1. Update Development section to include new scripts (10 minutes)
2. Add information about MCP schema updates (10 minutes)
3. Add a new section about database migrations (15 minutes)

### 5. Approval
- [x] Findings presented to user
- [x] Approach approved by user on March 16, 2024
