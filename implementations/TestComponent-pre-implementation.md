### 2. Findings Documentation

#### Existing Files Found:
- No existing TestComponent files found

#### Existing Functionality:
- No existing test component functionality

#### Gaps Identified:
- Need a simple component to test the pre-implementation checklist enforcement

#### Implementation Decision Tree:
- Is there existing code that serves this purpose? No
- Can existing code be enhanced to meet requirements? No
- Is creating new code justified? Yes, needed for testing enforcement mechanisms

### 3. Proposed Approach:
- [x] Create new files (requires detailed justification)
  - Creating src/components/TestComponent.tsx for testing purposes
  - This is justified because we need a test file to verify the pre-implementation checklist enforcement

### 4. Implementation Plan:
1. Create TestComponent.tsx file (5 minutes)
2. Add basic React component structure (5 minutes)
3. Test pre-implementation checklist enforcement (10 minutes)
