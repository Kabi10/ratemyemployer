# Wall of Fame and Wall of Shame Pre-Implementation Checklist

## Existing Files Found:
- `src/app/fame/page.tsx` - Wall of Fame page
- `src/app/shame/page.tsx` - Wall of Shame page
- `src/components/WallOfCompanies.tsx` - Shared component for both walls
- `src/components/EnhancedCompanyCard.tsx` - Card component for displaying companies

## Existing Functionality:
- Basic Wall of Fame and Wall of Shame pages exist but have issues
- Company search functionality works but needs improvement
- Review system is in place but needs integration with the walls
- News fetching functionality exists but needs automation

## Gaps Identified:
- Wall of Fame and Wall of Shame pages are not displaying companies correctly
- Stored procedures for statistics are not working
- Test data is needed for proper testing
- News fetching needs automation via GitHub Actions
- Documentation is missing for the Wall features

## Implementation Decision Tree:
- Is there existing code that serves this purpose? Yes
- Can existing code be enhanced to meet requirements? Yes
- Is creating new code justified? Yes, for test data and automation

## Proposed Approach:
- [x] Fix the WallOfCompanies component to properly display companies
- [x] Replace stored procedures with direct queries and client-side processing
- [x] Create a script to add test data for both walls
- [x] Create a GitHub workflow for automated news fetching
- [x] Update README.md with documentation for the Wall features

## Implementation Plan:
1. Fix the WallOfCompanies component to properly display companies (2 hours)
2. Replace stored procedures with direct queries and client-side processing (3 hours)
3. Create a script to add test data for both walls (2 hours)
4. Create a GitHub workflow for automated news fetching (1 hour)
5. Update README.md with documentation for the Wall features (1 hour)

## Implementation Notes:

- Stored procedures were replaced with direct Supabase queries and client-side processing
- Test data script adds 5 companies with high ratings and 5 with low ratings
- GitHub workflow runs twice daily to fetch news for featured companies
