```

### 2. Findings Documentation

#### Existing Files Found:
- scripts/update-mcp-schema.ts
- scripts/run-migrations.ts

#### Existing Functionality:
- The scripts exist but there are no npm scripts to run them easily
- Current package.json has other MCP-related scripts but is missing these two

#### Gaps Identified:
- No easy way to run the MCP schema update script
- No easy way to run migrations

#### Implementation Decision Tree:
- Is there existing code that serves this purpose? Yes (the scripts exist)
- Can existing code be enhanced to meet requirements? Yes (by adding npm scripts)
- Is creating new code justified? No (only configuration changes needed)

### 3. Proposed Approach:
- [x] Enhance existing code at package.json
- [ ] Create new files (not needed)
- [ ] Refactor existing code (not needed)

### 4. Implementation Plan:
1. Add mcp:update-schema script to package.json (5 minutes)
2. Add migrations:run script to package.json (5 minutes)
3. Test the new scripts (10 minutes)

### 5. Approval
- [x] Findings presented to user
