# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive redundancy scan of the RateMyEmployer codebase to identify what is truly needed for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The goal is to distinguish between essential features that enable core functionality versus nice-to-have features that add complexity without providing critical value to users.

Based on the codebase analysis, the project has evolved into a feature-rich platform with significant complexity that may be hindering development velocity and maintainability. The core value proposition should be: "A simple platform where users can rate and review employers."

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core MVP Feature Identification

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to identify the absolute minimum features required for a functional employer review platform, so that I can focus development efforts on essential functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify core features that directly support the primary user journey of rating and reviewing employers
2. WHEN evaluating features THEN the system SHALL categorize each feature as "Essential", "Nice-to-Have", or "Bloat"
3. WHEN a feature is marked as "Essential" THEN it SHALL be required for basic platform functionality
4. IF a feature can be removed without breaking core user flows THEN it SHALL be classified as non-essential
5. WHEN identifying core features THEN the system SHALL prioritize user authentication, company profiles, review creation, and review display

### Requirement 2: Complexity Analysis and Reduction Recommendations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand which components, scripts, and dependencies add unnecessary complexity, so that I can streamline the codebase for better maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify packages that are not used in core MVP functionality
2. WHEN reviewing scripts THEN the system SHALL categorize automation scripts by necessity for MVP operation
3. WHEN examining components THEN the system SHALL identify UI components that could be simplified or consolidated
4. IF a script or component serves only advanced features THEN it SHALL be marked for potential removal
5. WHEN analyzing the build process THEN the system SHALL identify unnecessary build steps and configurations

### Requirement 3: Documentation and Tooling Overhead Assessment

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to identify documentation and tooling that creates maintenance overhead without providing proportional value, so that I can reduce cognitive load on the development team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL identify docs that are not essential for MVP development and deployment
2. WHEN analyzing tooling THEN the system SHALL categorize tools by their necessity for core development workflows
3. WHEN evaluating monitoring and analytics THEN the system SHALL distinguish between essential error tracking and nice-to-have metrics
4. IF documentation covers advanced features not in MVP THEN it SHALL be marked as non-essential
5. WHEN assessing CI/CD complexity THEN the system SHALL identify steps that could be simplified for MVP deployment

### Requirement 4: Database Schema and API Simplification

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to identify database tables, columns, and API endpoints that are not required for core functionality, so that I can simplify the data model and reduce maintenance burden.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing database schema THEN the system SHALL identify tables and columns not used in core user flows
2. WHEN reviewing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL categorize endpoints by their necessity for MVP functionality
3. WHEN examining data relationships THEN the system SHALL identify complex relationships that could be simplified
4. IF a database feature serves only advanced functionality THEN it SHALL be marked for potential removal
5. WHEN analyzing migrations THEN the system SHALL identify schema changes that added complexity without core value

### Requirement 5: Feature Flag and Configuration Simplification

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to identify configuration options and feature flags that add complexity without providing essential functionality, so that I can simplify deployment and reduce configuration drift.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing environment variables THEN the system SHALL identify configs not required for basic operation
2. WHEN analyzing feature flags THEN the system SHALL categorize flags by their necessity for MVP functionality
3. WHEN examining build configurations THEN the system SHALL identify complex settings that could be simplified
4. IF a configuration option serves only advanced features THEN it SHALL be marked as non-essential
5. WHEN assessing deployment complexity THEN the system SHALL identify steps that could be streamlined for MVP

### Requirement 6: Testing Strategy Optimization

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to identify which tests are essential for MVP quality assurance versus those that test advanced features, so that I can focus testing efforts on core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test suites THEN the system SHALL identify tests that cover core MVP functionality
2. WHEN reviewing test complexity THEN the system SHALL categorize tests by their importance for basic platform stability
3. WHEN examining testing tools THEN the system SHALL identify tools that are overkill for MVP testing needs
4. IF a test covers only advanced features THEN it SHALL be marked as non-essential for MVP
5. WHEN assessing test coverage THEN the system SHALL prioritize coverage of core user journeys over advanced features

### Requirement 7: Performance and Monitoring Simplification

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want to identify monitoring, analytics, and performance tools that are excessive for MVP needs, so that I can reduce operational complexity while maintaining essential observability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing monitoring tools THEN the system SHALL distinguish between essential error tracking and advanced analytics
2. WHEN reviewing performance monitoring THEN the system SHALL identify metrics that are not critical for MVP operation
3. WHEN examining logging systems THEN the system SHALL categorize logs by their necessity for basic troubleshooting
4. IF a monitoring feature serves only advanced use cases THEN it SHALL be marked as non-essential
5. WHEN assessing alerting systems THEN the system SHALL identify alerts that are critical for MVP stability

### Requirement 8: Actionable Reduction Roadmap

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want a prioritized roadmap for removing or simplifying non-essential features, so that I can plan the transition to a streamlined MVP while minimizing disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the reduction roadmap THEN the system SHALL prioritize removals by impact and effort
2. WHEN planning feature removal THEN the system SHALL identify dependencies that must be addressed
3. WHEN sequencing changes THEN the system SHALL ensure core functionality remains intact throughout the process
4. IF removing a feature affects other components THEN the system SHALL document the impact and mitigation steps
5. WHEN estimating effort THEN the system SHALL provide realistic timelines for each reduction phase
