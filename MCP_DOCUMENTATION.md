```

### Using MCP in Cursor

Once the MCP server is running, you can use natural language to interact with your database in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Make sure the MCP server is running
3. Type natural language queries in comments or as questions to the AI

For example:

```typescript
// Show me the top 5 highest-rated companies
```

Or ask directly:

"What are the average ratings by industry?"

### Running Sample Queries

To see examples of the types of queries you can run with MCP:

```bash
npm run mcp:sample-queries
```

This will execute several sample queries against your database and display the results.

## üìö Stored Procedures

The MCP integration includes several stored procedures that enhance its capabilities. However, due to potential compatibility issues with PostgreSQL versions and reserved keywords, we've also implemented a TypeScript-based statistics module as an alternative approach.

### Alternative: TypeScript Statistics Module

We've implemented a TypeScript-based statistics module in `src/lib/statistics.ts` that provides similar functionality to the stored procedures but with improved reliability and type safety. This module includes:

- **`getIndustryStatistics`**: Returns statistics grouped by industry (with reviews)
- **`getLocationStatistics`**: Returns statistics grouped by location (with reviews)
- **`getAllIndustryStatistics`**: Returns statistics for all industries (including those without reviews)
- **`getAllLocationStatistics`**: Returns statistics for all locations (including those without reviews)

These functions directly query the Supabase database and process the results in JavaScript, providing a more reliable alternative to stored procedures. They are used in the `MCPDemoComponent` and `WallOfCompanies` components.

### `get_average_ratings_by_industry`

Returns the average ratings for companies grouped by industry.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: Table with columns `industry` and `average_rating`

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_average_ratings_by_industry();
```

**Note**: This stored procedure has been replaced by the `getIndustryStatistics` function in the TypeScript statistics module.

### `get_review_submission_trends`

Returns the count of reviews submitted per month.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: Table with columns `month` and `review_count`

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_review_submission_trends();
```

### `get_top_companies_by_industry`

Returns the top-rated companies in a specific industry.

**Parameters**:
- `p_industry` (text): The industry to filter by
- `p_limit` (integer): Maximum number of companies to return

**Returns**: Table with company details and average ratings

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_top_companies_by_industry('Technology', 5);
```

### `get_recent_reviews_for_company`

Returns the most recent reviews for a specific company.

**Parameters**:
- `p_company_id` (integer): The ID of the company
- `p_limit` (integer): Maximum number of reviews to return

**Returns**: Table with review details

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_recent_reviews_for_company(123, 10);
```

### `search_companies`

Searches for companies by name or location.

**Parameters**:
- `p_search_term` (text): The search term to look for
- `p_limit` (integer): Maximum number of companies to return

**Returns**: Table with company details

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM search_companies('tech', 20);
```

### `get_rating_distribution`

Returns the distribution of ratings across all reviews.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: Table with columns `rating` and `count`

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_rating_distribution();
```

### `get_companies_with_no_reviews`

Returns companies that have no reviews.

**Parameters**:
- `p_limit` (integer): Maximum number of companies to return

**Returns**: Table with company details

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_companies_with_no_reviews(10);
```

## üíª Using MCP in Your Code

### Example: Fetching Companies

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import type { Database } from '@/types/supabase';

// Create a Supabase client
const supabase = createClient<Database>(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);

// Fetch companies using a query generated by MCP
async function fetchCompanies() {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('companies')
      .select('*')
      .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
      .limit(10);
      
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching companies:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Example: Using MCP-Generated Queries

MCP can generate complex queries based on natural language input. For example:

```typescript
// Natural language: "Show me all companies in the Technology industry with ratings above 4"
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('companies')
  .select('*, reviews(*)')
  .eq('industry', 'Technology')
  .gte('average_rating', 4);
```

### Example: Using Stored Procedures

```typescript
// Use a stored procedure created by MCP
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_average_ratings_by_industry');

if (error) {
  console.error('Error fetching average ratings:', error);
} else {
  console.log('Average ratings by industry:', data);
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Missing Database Columns

If you encounter errors related to missing columns like `average_rating` or `total_reviews`, you need to run the database fixes script:

```bash
npm run mcp:fix-database
```

This script will:
- Add the missing columns to the companies table
- Update the columns with calculated values based on reviews
- Create the necessary stored procedures

#### 2. Missing exec_sql Function

If you see errors like "Could not find the function public.exec_sql", run the database fixes script:

```bash
npm run mcp:fix-database
```

If that doesn't work, you'll need to execute the SQL script directly in the Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Open the Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `scripts/mcp-database-fixes.sql`
4. Execute the script

**Important Note**: Due to limitations in the Supabase JavaScript client, some operations can only be performed directly in the SQL Editor. If you encounter persistent errors with the TypeScript approach, using the SQL script directly is the recommended solution.

#### 3. Stored Procedure Errors

If stored procedures are not working correctly, try:

1. Running the database fixes script:
   ```bash
   npm run mcp:fix-database
   ```

2. Then re-run the stored procedures setup:
   ```bash
   npm run mcp:setup-procedures
   ```

3. Restart the MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm run mcp:start
   ```

### Verifying the Setup

To verify that the MCP integration is working correctly:

1. Run the sample queries:
   ```bash
   npm run mcp:sample-queries
   ```

2. Check the MCP demo page:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to http://localhost:3000/mcp-demo
   ```

3. Test stored procedures directly:
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   SELECT * FROM get_average_ratings_by_industry();
   ```

### Database Schema Requirements

For the MCP integration to work correctly, the database schema must include:

1. **Companies Table**:
   - `id`: Primary key
   - `name`: Company name
   - `industry`: Industry category
   - `location`: Company location
   - `average_rating`: Average rating (calculated from reviews)
   - `total_reviews`: Total number of reviews

2. **Reviews Table**:
   - `id`: Primary key
   - `company_id`: Foreign key to companies table
   - `rating`: Numeric rating (1-5)
   - `title`: Review title
   - `pros`: Pros text
   - `cons`: Cons text
   - `created_at`: Timestamp

3. **Required Functions**:
   - `exec_sql(sql text)`: Helper function for executing dynamic SQL
   - `get_average_ratings_by_industry()`: Returns average ratings by industry
   - `get_companies_with_no_reviews()`: Returns companies with no reviews
   - `get_top_companies_by_industry(industry_name TEXT)`: Returns top companies in an industry
   - `get_recent_reviews_for_company(company_id_param INTEGER)`: Returns recent reviews for a company
   - `get_review_submission_trends()`: Returns review submission trends by month
   - `search_companies(search_term TEXT)`: Searches for companies by name, industry, or location
   - `get_rating_distribution()`: Returns the distribution of ratings
