## 📞 Support

If you need to restore any removed functionality:

1. **Check Git History**: All removed code is preserved in git history
2. **Review Requirements**: Ensure the feature aligns with current goals
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Look for simpler solutions first
4. **Plan Integration**: Ensure new features don't compromise MVP focus

## 📊 Success Metrics

The MVP streamlining achieved:
- ✅ 37% reduction in lines of code (16,553 lines removed)
