# PR Review Checklist - MVP Optimization

## üîç Code Review Points

### Architecture & Design
- [ ] **Simplified Architecture**: Review `docs/SIMPLIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md` for new structure
- [ ] **Migration Guide**: Check `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for completeness
- [ ] **Feature Removal**: Verify non-MVP features are properly removed
- [ ] **Core Features**: Ensure all MVP features are preserved and functional

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] **Build Success**: Verify `npm run build` completes without errors
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Check TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] **Import Optimization**: Review removed unused imports
- [ ] **Component Consolidation**: Verify unified component usage

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Core Functionality**: Run `npx tsx scripts/validate-core-functionality.ts`
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Execute `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] **Manual Testing**: Test key user journeys (auth, company search, review creation)
- [ ] **Performance**: Check bundle size and load times

### Documentation
- [ ] **README Updates**: Verify MVP focus is clearly communicated
- [ ] **Spec Documentation**: Review `.kiro/specs/mvp-redundancy-analysis/`
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Check inline documentation is updated
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Ensure API changes are documented

## üéØ Key Areas to Focus On

### 1. Removed Features Impact
- Verify no critical functionality was accidentally removed
- Check that removed features have clear alternatives documented
- Ensure user experience remains smooth despite feature removal

### 2. Performance Improvements
- Test page load times before/after
- Verify bundle size reduction claims
- Check memory usage improvements

### 3. Maintainability Gains
- Review code complexity reduction
- Check if new developer onboarding is easier
- Verify dependency management is simplified

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Risks to Watch For

### Breaking Changes
- [ ] **API Compatibility**: Ensure existing API contracts are maintained
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Verify migrations don't break existing data
- [ ] **User Sessions**: Check authentication flows still work
- [ ] **External Integrations**: Verify third-party services still function

### Performance Regressions
- [ ] **Core Features**: Ensure optimization didn't slow down essential features
- [ ] **Database Queries**: Check query performance isn't degraded
- [ ] **UI Responsiveness**: Verify interface remains snappy

## üìä Metrics to Validate

### Before/After Comparison
- [ ] **Lines of Code**: 44,142 ‚Üí 27,589 (37% reduction)
- [ ] **File Count**: 392 ‚Üí 280 (29% reduction)
- [ ] **Dependencies**: 77 ‚Üí 64 (17% reduction)
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Verify ~2.7MB estimate

### Functionality Validation
- [ ] **Authentication**: Login/logout/registration works
- [ ] **Company Management**: CRUD operations functional
- [ ] **Review System**: Create/read/update/delete reviews
- [ ] **Search**: Company and review search working

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] **Database Migrations**: Review and test migration scripts
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Verify all required env vars are set
- [ ] **Build Process**: Ensure CI/CD pipeline handles new structure

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] **Error Rates**: Monitor for increased errors
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Track Core Web Vitals
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Watch for user complaints about missing features

## ‚úÖ Approval Criteria
