## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

RateMyEmployer includes integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which enables natural language interaction with the Supabase database through AI tools like Cursor.

### Key Features

- Query the database using plain English instead of SQL
- Generate complex queries without writing SQL
- Analyze company ratings, review trends, and user activity
- Integrate AI-powered queries into your application

### Getting Started with MCP

1. Set up the MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm run mcp:setup
   ```

2. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm run mcp:start
   ```
   
   Or use the interactive runner:
   ```bash
   npm run mcp:runner
   ```

3. Visit the MCP demo page at `/mcp-demo` to see it in action

### Updating MCP Schema

If your Supabase schema changes, you can update the MCP schema:

```bash
npm run mcp:update-schema
```

This will fetch the latest schema from your Supabase instance and update the MCP configuration files.

### Statistics Module

As an alternative to PostgreSQL stored procedures, we've implemented a TypeScript-based statistics module in `src/lib/statistics.ts`. This module provides:

- Industry and location statistics calculation
- Improved reliability over SQL stored procedures
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Better error handling and debugging
- Easy integration with React components

To use the statistics module:

```typescript
import { 
  getIndustryStatistics, 
  getAllIndustryStatistics,
  getLocationStatistics,
  getAllLocationStatistics 
} from '@/lib/statistics';

// Example usage
const industryStats = await getIndustryStatistics();
```

For more details, see the [statistics module documentation](src/lib/README.md).

For comprehensive documentation on the MCP integration, see [MCP_DOCUMENTATION.md](MCP_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Database Migrations

RateMyEmployer uses database migrations to manage schema changes. The migrations are stored in the `supabase/migrations` directory.

### Running Migrations

To run database migrations:

```bash
npm run migrations:run
```

This will apply any pending migrations to your Supabase instance.

### Creating New Migrations

1. Create a new SQL file in the `supabase/migrations` directory with a timestamp prefix
2. Write your migration SQL in the file
3. Run the migrations using the command above

### Migration Best Practices

- Always test migrations in a development environment first
- Back up your database before running migrations in production
- Keep migrations small and focused on specific changes
- Include both "up" and "down" migrations when possible
- Document complex migrations with comments

For more details on database management, see the [Database Guide](docs/DATABASE_GUIDE.md).
